## Orchard CMS "For Devies"

During one of the steering committee meetings, someone said, 
> "Orchard is like having a magic wand with no instructions".  

I can't remember who said it but I thought that was on point.

The goal here is basically, instructions for the magic wand.

Why a book and not just the documentation on orchardproject.net?  Theoretically, we should do both, but a book has the benefit of the intended audience. Whereas the online documentation is for everyone, usually those willing to buy a book are those who want a more technical, detailed source of documentation (IMHO).
